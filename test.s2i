[IBIS Ver]		3.2

[File name]     tx.ibs

[File rev] 		1.0

[date]  April 1, 2004
[source] From MegaFLOPS Inc. layout and silicon models.
[notes] This is not an actual device. No one would buy it anyway.
[disclaimer] This file is only for demonstration purposes. It describes
a really crummy chip containing a couple of tri-state drivers and an
output-only driver, along with clamp diodes running off of a different
power supply.

You can put blank lines in any of these sections. (But s2ibis3 won't
print them.)

Of course, as noted in the documentation, any text in these sections is
truncated at 1KB.

| Give the spice type.  Allowable values are hspice, pspice, spice2,
| spice3 spectre and eldo.
|
|
| Now specify some global parameters. These parameters will apply to
| _all_ the models in this file.
|
| Note on the [Temperature range] keyword: Since this is a CMOS circuit,
| the min column contains the highest temperature, since this temperature
| causes or amplifies the "min" (slow, weak) behavior, while the max
| column contains the lowest temperature, since this temperature causes or
| amplifies the "max" (fast, strong) behavior.  If this were a bipolar
| circuit, these temperature values would be reversed.
|
| Since we have the clamp diodes running off of a different voltage, we
| need to use the [pullup reference] etc. keywords to set up the
| different supplies. We also need to use the [pin map] keyword to
| specify which structures connect to various power/ground buses.

|
| Now specify the pin mapping. In this case, all of the clamp structures
| will connect to the buses CLMP_VDD and CLMP_GND, while the drivers
| will connect to DRV_VDD and DRV_GND. CLMP_VDD is supplied by pin 7,
| CLMP_GND is supplied by pin 6, DRV_VDD is supplied by pin 12, and
| DRV_GND is supplied by pin 1.
| 
| Note that all of the power and ground pins, regardless of whether or not
| they supply clamp structures or drivers, have their bus entries in the
| pulldown and pullup columns (e.g. pins 1, 6, 7 and 12).

| Now specify the pin list.
